# Amazon Bedrock – Generative AI Layer

This folder documents how Amazon Bedrock is used as the Generative AI interface within the AWS AI system.

Amazon Bedrock provides access to large foundation models (LLMs) without requiring model training, infrastructure management, or direct data exposure.

---

## Role of Amazon Bedrock in This System

In this architecture, Amazon Bedrock is used to:

- Accept natural language input from users
- Retrieve relevant, curated information from trusted data sources
- Generate explanations, summaries, and contextual responses
- Present AI outputs in a controlled and secure manner

Amazon Bedrock does **not** make business decisions or predictions on its own.

---

## What Amazon Bedrock Is Used For

- Natural language interfaces (chat, Q&A, summaries)
- Explanation of machine learning outputs
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Interpreting structured and unstructured curated data
- Human-friendly access to AI insights

---

## What Amazon Bedrock Is NOT Used For

- Training machine learning models
- Making risk, scoring, or classification decisions
- Processing raw or unvalidated data
- Acting as a system of record

Analytical decisions remain the responsibility of machine learning models in Amazon SageMaker.

---

## Data Access Pattern

Amazon Bedrock does not access raw data directly.

Instead, it interacts with:

- Curated datasets stored in Amazon S3
- Vector databases containing embedded representations
- Outputs generated by machine learning models

This approach reduces hallucination risk and ensures responses are grounded in trusted information.

---

## Why Bedrock Is Used Instead of Custom LLM Hosting

- No infrastructure management
- Built-in security and IAM integration
- Enterprise-grade data isolation
- Pay-per-use cost model
- Easy model switching without architectural changes

---

## Security and Governance Considerations

- Access controlled via IAM roles
- No training on customer data
- Data remains within AWS-managed services
- Prompts and responses can be logged and audited

---

## Summary

Amazon Bedrock acts as the **interaction layer** of the AI system.

It enhances understanding and usability while relying on curated data and machine learning models to ensure accuracy, trust, and responsible AI usage.
