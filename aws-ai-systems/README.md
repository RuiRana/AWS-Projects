# AWS AI Systems

This folder contains projects and experiments focused on building AI systems using AWS-native services.

The goal is to demonstrate:
- How curated data supports AI systems
- When to use Machine Learning (Amazon SageMaker)
- When to use Generative AI (Amazon Bedrock)
- When pre-built AI services are sufficient
- How AI systems can be designed responsibly and cost-effectively on AWS

This work focuses on system design and decision-making, not just individual service usage.
