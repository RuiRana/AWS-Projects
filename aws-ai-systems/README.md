# AWS AI Systems

This folder contains projects and experiments focused on building AI systems using AWS-native services.

The goal is to demonstrate:
- How curated data supports AI systems
- When to use Machine Learning (Amazon SageMaker)
- When to use Generative AI (Amazon Bedrock)
- When pre-built AI services are sufficient
- How AI systems can be designed responsibly and cost-effectively on AWS

This work focuses on system design and decision-making, not just individual service usage.
## Status
Initial structure created.

## Flagship Use Case (Draft)

This project explores how an organisation can use AWS-native AI services to safely extract insight from its internal data and make that information accessible through a generative AI interface.

The focus is on:
- Using curated data rather than raw data
- Applying Machine Learning where decisions or scoring are required
- Using Generative AI to explain, summarise, and interact with information
- Ensuring security, governance, and cost-awareness throughout the design
